# Blockapps-js Interactive Tutorial

[Blockapps-js](https://github.com/blockapps/blockapps-js) is an API library development by [Blockapps](http://blockapps.net/) which provides an interface for Javascript applications (Web or Console) to interact with [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) network which is a Turing-complete programming language built on the top of blockchain.

This is an interactive tutorial aimed to demonstrate how blockapps-js library could be used. It uses an live editor which allows a user to edit code (powered by [C9](https://github.com/c9/core/)), and has Javascript code validation (powered by Khan Academy's [StructuredJS](http://khan.github.io/structuredjs/)). The app is built using Dave Zuko's [React Redux Starter Kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit) and is written in ES6 syntax (using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)).

The tutorial is mostly complete, the only component remaining is it's automatic deployment to gh-pages.
